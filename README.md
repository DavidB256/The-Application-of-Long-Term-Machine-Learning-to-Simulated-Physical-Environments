# The Application of Ling-Term Machine Learning to Simulated Physical Environments

This is the Honors Project of David Bass, made for the purpose of earning the WJCC Honors Diploma.  It is a two-part project; the first part is to create a 2d physics engine and a graphics engine to display its output.  The second part is to research the efficacy of various machine learning techniques within the simulated physics environment.
