# The Application of Ling-Term Machine Learning to Simulated Physical Environments

This is the Honors Project of David Bass, made with the intention of earning the WJCC Honors Diploma.  It is a two-part project; the first part is to create a 2-D physics engine and a graphics engine to display its output.  The second part is the create new, and compare with existing, machine learning techniques for teaching an AI to perform certain tasks in the simulated physical environment.
